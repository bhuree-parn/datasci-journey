# Stack Overflow Trends

**Goal:** Analyze how programming language popularity has changed over time using Stack Overflow data.  

**Contents:**  
- `stack_overflow_trends.ipynb` → Jupyter notebook with the full analysis.  
- `by_tag_year.csv` / `stack_overflow.csv` → datasets used in the analysis.  

**Reflection:**  
This was my first full DataCamp project, completed after finishing the first four mini-courses in the Associate Data Scientist in R track (Introduction to R, Intermediate R, Introduction to the Tidyverse, and Data Manipulation with dplyr).  
Although very basic, it represents an important **first step** in my coding journey.  
While the courses taught me individual functions, this project helped me see how they **connect together in practice** to clean, manipulate, and analyze real data.  
Everything here was completely new to me, so I am proud to have worked through it and produced a complete analysis.  
It also reinforced the importance of tidy data and reproducible workflows — skills directly transferable to working with medical and research datasets.
