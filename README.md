# Data Science Journey (R Track)

This repository documents my progress through the **Associate Data Scientist in R** track on DataCamp.  
I am approaching this from **zero prior coding experience**, using DataCamp as my first structured exposure to programming and data analysis.  

## 🎯 Purpose
The aim of this repo is to consolidate and showcase my work as I develop practical skills in **R programming, data analysis, and statistical modeling**.  
My focus is on applying these skills to **medical research, precision medicine, and AI in healthcare**.  

## 📂 Contents
- **Projects** → Selected bonus projects from the DataCamp track, curated and documented.  
- **Journal** → A record of progress and reflections on challenges, key concepts, and potential medical applications.  

## 📈 Growth Mindset
I view this as part of my commitment to **continuous professional development**.  
By learning independently and building a foundation in data science during medical school, I aim to bridge **clinical knowledge and data-driven insights**.
